# menu.sh - build a display-menu without hand-quoting anything.
#
# Promotes the args-array convention already written three times
# (tracker.sh:882, mesh.sh:1335, session-order.sh:80) and replaces
# tmux-worktree's `eval "tmux display-menu -T '$title' $options"`, where the
# menu is assembled as one string by ten awk scripts and every layer adds
# another round of backslashes.
#
# The quoting is the whole point. A menu item's third field is a *tmux command
# string*, which tmux parses, and inside it `run-shell '<sh>'` is a *shell*
# command string, which /bin/sh parses. Two nested parsers, and a branch name
# with a space or an apostrophe breaks both. tk_menu_cmd does that quoting once.
